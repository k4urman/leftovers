**Start**
by: Kaurman, Srishti, and Soorya

Questions to Discuss
----------------------
- What languages will we be utilizing? Python & Java.
- Website or App? App.
- SQL or just use CSV files and Python? SQL. 
- How will we make this known and popular around campus? Posters? Word of mouth? Word will spread naturally trust.
- How will the app work? (The logistics?) 

Possible Logistics
---------------------
HTML Page with CSS and Javascript. Use Java with Java Server Pages and use SQL+Maven for all the database stuff. We could ditch Java for Python? Anyways, the person will sign-up (needs to do this), pick their building (North Hall or LUX), and then either list a food item or contact the person for their food item. 

We could lowkey just use Django because fuck Java
