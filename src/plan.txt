Project: Leftovers - Free Food Sharing Desktop App

Objective:
Develop a desktop application using Java, Spring Boot, and JavaFX to allow users to share and claim free food based on their location, reducing food waste. The app will include a backend for managing food listings and users, and a JavaFX GUI for posting food, viewing nearby listings, and claiming food.

1. Project Scope
----------------
- Core Features:
  - Post food items with title, description, and location (latitude/longitude).
  - View nearby food listings within a configurable radius (default: 10 km).
  - Claim food to mark it as unavailable.
  - Simple map visualization using JavaFX Canvas to show user and food locations.
- Tech Stack:
  - Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Lombok
  - Frontend: JavaFX (controls and FXML)
  - Database: In-memory H2 database (for development)
- Constraints:
  - JavaFX lacks native geolocation; use manual coordinate input.
  - Keep dependencies minimal; avoid external mapping libraries for simplicity.
  - No authentication for initial version to focus on core functionality.
